### For councillors who SUPPORT Just Cause Eviction: Tito Jackson, Ayanna Pressley, Matt O'Malley


*Email subject line:* Just Cause Eviction support

Dear Cllr *[your councilor's name]*,

As a local resident I am writing to thank you for your support with Just Cause Eviction (JCE). I ask you to continue to commit to JCE by encouraging your colleagues who are less committed to support this cause. As you know, this is a cause that needs urgent support from our city leaders.

Boston is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. With this comes the pressure of development in our neighborhoods and the displacement of residents who have called Boston their home for years, even generations. We cannot wait to create tenant protections and your city needs you to act now.

As an example, three families on Ruggles Street in Roxbury have been ordered to leave their homes that they have each lived in for 15-20 years. This is not because they failed paid rent or because they have violated their lease, but because the owner, the Mayo Group, sees an opportunity to make a profit. Already 10 families in this development have left. Five remain and if we have protections like Just Cause Eviction this would not be an issue.

The worst part is that this is just one story of what is happening across our city. We have a right to remain and I ask that you help move forward the Just Cause Eviction and continue to join me to say, "No!" to forced displacement and no fault evictions. We cannot allow this injustice to continue spreading in our neighborhoods of Boston.

Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

*[your name]*

Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you.
