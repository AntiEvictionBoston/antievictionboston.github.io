Let your City Councillor know we need stronger protections from "evictions for profit" in Boston. Below is a message you can email to your City Councillor to express your support for stronger protections. Copy and paste it to compose an email from your email account. Or, compose an email in your own words.

### For councillors who SUPPORT Just Cause Eviction: 
**Tito Jackson, Ayanna Pressley, Matt O'Malley**


**Email subject line:** Just Cause Eviction support

Dear Cllr **[your councillor's name]**,

As a local resident I want to thank you for supporting Just Cause Eviction (JCE). I ask you to continue to commit to JCE by encouraging your less committed colleagues to support this cause. As you know, this is a cause that needs urgent support from our city leaders.

Boston is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. With this growth has come the pressure of development in our neighborhoods and the displacement of residents who have called Boston their home for years, even generations. We cannot wait to create tenant protections. Your city needs action now.

Three families on Ruggles Street in Roxbury have been ordered to leave the place they've each called home for 15-20 years, not because they failed to pay rent or violated the lease, but because the owner, the Mayo Group, sees an opportunity to make a profit. 10 families in this development have left already; five remain. When we have protections like Just Cause Eviction, this kind of displacement will no longer be an issue.

The Ruggles Street evictions are just one example of what is happening across our city. We have a right to remain and I ask that you help move Just Cause Eviction forward and continue to join me in saying, "No!" to forced displacement through no fault evictions. We cannot allow this injustice to continue spreading in our Boston neighborhoods. 

Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

**[your name]**
