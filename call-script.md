Let your City Councillor know we need stronger protections from "evictions for profit" in Boston. Below is a message you can use while calling your City Councillor to express your support for stronger protections. Or, use your own words.

Hello,

My name is _(your name)_ and I am a member/concerned resident of _(member group and/or neighborhood)._  I’m calling to urge you _(your city councilor’s name)_ to come out in favor of a Just-Cause Eviction (JCE) ordinance NOW, and to work with your colleagues to get this law introduced and passed.

No‐fault evictions by corporate landlords are displacing many families in my neighborhood, and City Council action is urgently needed to stop this. Will you please support the Just-Cause Eviction ordinance and encourage your fellow colleagues to do the same?
