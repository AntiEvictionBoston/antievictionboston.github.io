title: Concentrations of "rent-burdened" tenants in Boston
description: "Where are Boston renters paying 30% or more of their income in rent? It's a longstanding financial rule-of-thumb that if a tenant is paying 30% or more of their income in rent, it's no longer an affordable or stable tenancy. This map shows where people are paying rent beyond their means - and where people are most at risk of displacement by rent increase. Data source: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/\">American Community Survey 2011-2014</a>"
