title: Boston Tenants Fighting Displacement
description: "This interactive map of Boston renters’ stories tells a tale of evictions and displacement in our increasingly upscale rental market. Who is getting pushed out as rents rise and higher-income earners move in? These stories don’t represent the scale of no-fault evictions in Boston (complete and accurate data on no-fault evictions not possible to represent at this time), but they begin to illuminate the human impact. Also, this small sampling of stories is just the start of this project. Exact pin locations have been adjusted slightly for privacy reasons."
